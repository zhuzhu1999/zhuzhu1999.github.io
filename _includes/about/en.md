Hi, I am zhuzhu, a mathematics and economics student. I take an interest in a bunch of things, ranging from pop and classical music, mystery fiction, and suspense movies, to cooking. I am an amateur in piano and hiking, planning to learn guitar and Japanese.

I'm currently learning website construction and data science as well as studying matching theory in economics. I am also passionate about acquiring something regarding the law.

I got my BSc in mathematics and economics and MA with a focus on economics. I especially enjoy economic theory and mechanism design. Previously been in Amoy, Hong Kong, San Diego, etc., I am now located in Chicago, USA.
