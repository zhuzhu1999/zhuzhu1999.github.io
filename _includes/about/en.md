Hi, I am zhuzhu, a mathematics and economics student. I take an interest in a bunch of things, ranging from classical music and mystery fiction to suspense movies and cooking. I am an amateur in piano and hiking who am also learning guitar and Japanese.

I'm currently learning website construction and data science and studying matching theory in economics. I am also passionate about acquiring something regarding the law. I got my BSc in mathematics and economics and MA with a focus on economics. I especially enjoy economic theory and mechanism design. 

Previously been in Amoy, Hong Kong, San Diego, etc., I am now located in Chicago, USA.
